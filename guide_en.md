# Wrap-up

***by Hugo Pompougnac***

You have reached the end of this short guide (excluding the annexes). We do hope you enjoyed reading it, or at least found it useful. If so, we have a favor to ask of you. As mentioned in the introduction, this version of the guide is still very much a work in progress. We believe there is plenty to add, perhaps remove, correct, and improve. With this in mind, our primary concern is its usefulness to activists, so your feedback after reading it is very important. Please email us at contact@espaces-marx.eu with any comments, criticism, or suggestions.

You can also write to us if you would like to actively contribute to the writing process. If you are comfortable with digital tools, we invite you to interact with us via GitHub, visit the guide repository (github.com/espaces-marx/ai-radicals), fork it, and send us a Pull Request. We welcome all contributions and would be happy to build a larger activist community, working together to develop skills so that the left can better master new technologies.

For the moment, our intention for the next version of the guide is to:  

- Provide concrete examples and in-depth explanations of "advanced" AI tools (agents, connectors, libraries, etc.).
- Detail other tools; for now, we have focused on Mistral, although much of our advice applies equally well to other AIs.
- Provide more specific advice on AI-assisted data synthesis (summarizing a legal text, etc.).
- Teach AI-assisted graphic design techniques: not just by writing a trivial prompt and marveling at the result, but by combining AI with other techniques to create a poster, sticker, Instagram visual, etc.

Looking ahead, we would like to explain (in the clearest way possible) how to retrain an AI model at home to transform its purpose. But that's a more geeky goal; for the time being, we believe there are more pressing matters.

If you would like to comment on these objectives or suggest others, please contact us at our email address.

*Arrivederci!*
