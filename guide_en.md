# How Can AI Be Useful in Activist Life?

***By Anaïs Fley***


AI is not here to replace collective intelligence or militant work, but to save time, simplify technical tasks, and amplify the impact of our actions. Here are three concrete situations where it can be an asset, with examples drawn from militant current events.


## Writing a Short, Mobilizing Leaflet

> *See the full example [in the appendix](#leaflet-example).*


### Situation:

A demonstration or strike is planned (e.g., against government policy, a general mobilization day). You need a punchy leaflet, quick to distribute, that inspires action. A statement has already been published in response to government announcements.

***Why use AI?***

- It helps **skip the blank page stage**: you can build on initial elements obtained quickly.
- It **summarizes key issues** from an article or statement.
- It **suggests mobilizing phrasing** (slogans, calls to action).
- It **adapts the tone** (urgent, combative, educational).


### Concrete Example:

Based on a *given statement* attached, ask:

*"Write a 500-character leaflet for a demonstration against government policy, using this statement. Use a combative tone, summarizing the 3 key arguments from the statement and the call to join the demo. Reuse the statement’s title and add a catchy slogan."*


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **Layout software** (Canva, LibreOffice) to produce the leaflet, add colors, logos, or images.
- **Collective proofreading** to ensure the message aligns with the group’s political line.
- **As many collectively developed content elements as possible:** : the best slogans and demands are those activists create themselves, based on their understanding of the audience’s mindset.


### Caution:

- **Verify** dates, locations, and demands: AI can invent or distort information.
- **Personalize** with local details (meeting place, contacts).
  

## Turning an Article into a Short Video Script

See the full example [in the appendix](#script-example).


### Situation:

Your collective wants to publish a video on social media to explain an issue (e.g., why September 10 is a key date). You have a reference article but no time to adapt it for oral delivery.

*Why use AI?*

- It extracts key ideas and **reformulates them for speech**.
- It **suggests a structure** (introduction, development, conclusion).
- It **adjusts the pace** for a 1- to 3-minute video.


### How to Do It?

Paste the article link and ask:

*"Turn this article into a script for a 2-minute face-camera video. Use an engaged tone, with short sentences and pauses for breathing."*

Specify the style: *"Speak directly to the camera, as if addressing comrades."*


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **A smartphone or camera** (even a basic one).
- **A decent microphone** (or a quiet place to avoid background noise).
- **Editing software** (CapCut, OpenShot) (CapCut, OpenShot) to add subtitles or archive images.


### Caution:

- **Test** the script aloud: Some phrases may read well but sound awkward when spoken.
- **Add** images or subtitles to make the video more dynamic.


## Creating a Tutorial for Activists

Un tutoriel est un guide qui détaille étape par étape comment acquérir une nouvelle compétence.

> *For example, a tutorial on how to use a kettle would detail all these steps:*
>
> *1. First, plug it in.*
>
> *2. Add water (preferably filtered to avoid limescale buildup).*
>
> *3. Press the button to heat (for newer models, explain how to select the right temperature).*
>
> *4. Wait for the kettle to beep, indicating the water has reached the desired temperature (or 100°C by default).
>
> *5. Choose a suitable container for the amount of hot water needed (pot for pasta, cup for tea, etc.) and its heat resistance (avoid plastic cups).
>
> *6. Be careful not to burn yourself when pouring boiling water, handling the container, or drinking.
>
> *7. Ensure the kettle is turned off.
>
> *8. Regularly maintain the kettle (detail cleaning steps).
>
> This example shows that even if it seems overly detailed, each step is important: what’s obvious to some may not be to others and could block their understanding!


### Situation:

Your collective wants to train members in a new skill (e.g., organizing a general assembly, using encryption tools, planning a direct action). Writing a clear, educational tutorial takes time, especially if the topic is technical or unfamiliar.

*Why use AI?*

- It can **structure information** from existing notes or resources.
- It **adapts language** to make it accessible to everyone.
- It **generates examples** or detailed steps.


### How to Do It?

- **Provide a base:** paste notes, an article, or a list of ideas.
- **Specify the audience:** "Write a tutorial for beginner activists, with simple steps and concrete examples."
- **Request an adapted format:** “make me a 2-page handout, with boxes for key points.”


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **Proofread and test** the tutorial with comrades to ensure clarity, functionality, and accuracy.
- **Write** what you can, add phrases, and make the text your own.
- **Add** visuals (diagrams, screenshots) if needed.


### Caution:

AI may omit important details or suggest methods unsuitable for your context. **Always adapt the result to your local reality.**


## When Is AI Not Suitable?

- **For complex political positions:** AI cannot replace collective debate.
- **For highly technical or local topics:** it may lack precision.
- **For sensitive content** (action strategies, confidential information).

To sum up:

| Task             | AI Usefulness          | What else you need        | Caution          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- |
| **Leaflet**      | Summarize, mobilize    | Layout, local info        | Fact-check       |
| **Video Script** | Adapt for speech, pace | Audio/video gear, editing | Test aloud       |
| **Tutorial**     | Structure, simplify    | Proofreading, visuals     | Adapt to context |
