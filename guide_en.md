**Call to action: Let's fight together against student poverty!**

---

>**Poverty is not inevitable; it is a political choice!**
>
>In 2025, studying is still synonymous with hardship. Far from being a mere transition, student poverty has become the norm: exorbitant rents, exhausting part-time jobs, insufficient grants, and crowded lecture halls where we are prepared for an increasingly precarious job market. Meanwhile, the profits of large corporations and tax breaks for the wealthiest are skyrocketing. **Our hardship finances their prosperity.**
>
>**Broken promises, violated rights**
>
>We are promised social mobility, but what we get are crumbling staircases. Successive governments have abandoned students: disguised increases in tuition fees, cuts to financial aid, and a public university system that is being suffocated. Meanwhile, unpaid internships are on the rise, and fixed-term contracts follow one after another with no hope of stability. **Our future is being sacrificed on the altar of profit.**
>
>**The anger is legitimate, the fight is necessary**
>
>Given this situation, resignation is not an option. All over France, collectives are rising up: university occupations, rent strikes, university cafeteria blockades. These actions show one thing: **when we organize, we can bring the system to its knees.** Precariousness is not inevitable, but the result of a capitalist system that exploits us. It's time to fight back.
>
>**Join the movement!**
>
>**Saturday, October 4, 2025, let's take to the streets en masse!** Meet at 2 p.m. at Place de la République (Paris) and in all major cities across France.
>
>**Our revendications :**
>
>- **Free tuition**: not a single euro more for enrollment fees!
>- **A decent student income**: a minimum of €1,200 for everyone!
>- **Social and affordable housing**: stop real estate speculation at our expense!
>- **Stable and decent jobs**: an end to precarious internships and fixed-term contracts!
>
>**Let's organize, unionize, and fight together!** Precariousness is a weapon used against us. **Let's turn it into collective strength.**
>
>**Capitalism is stealing our future. Let's take it back by force.**

>**Together against student poverty**
>
>Student poverty is a scourge that affects millions of young people in France. Every day, students struggle to survive, juggling classes, part-time jobs, and exorbitant rents. It's time to put an end to this unacceptable situation!
>
>**A system on its last legs**
>
>The current economic model prioritizes profit at the expense of education. Tuition fees are skyrocketing, financial aid is insufficient, and living conditions are deteriorating. Students should not have to choose between eating and succeeding in their studies. We must demand access to education for all, without conditions.
>
>**Solidarity, our weapon**
>
>In the face of this precariousness, solidarity is our best ally. We must unite *-- students, workers, and citizens --* to make our voices heard. Past struggles have shown us that collective mobilization can bring about change. Together, we are stronger!
