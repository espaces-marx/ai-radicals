# How to Start Using AI?

## Where to Begin? Choosing Your Tool

There are dozens of AI tools available, but not all are equal. Here are some common options:

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :-------- | :------------ |
| **Mistral AI (Le Chat)** | Partially open source, subject to European law, which is more protective of personal data. | Less well-known than American giants, sometimes less intuitive interface. Capitalist company closely linked to the French government. |
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** | Very popular, simple interface., high performance. | Proprietary, controlled by Silicon Valley capitalists, massive data collection. |
| **Deepseek** | Free, partially open source, high performance. | Data security and management still poorly documented, closely monitored by the Chinese government, sometimes slow due to server overloads. |

*Why do we recommend Mistral?*
- **More reliable:e** Mistral is a European company, less tied to American giants like ChatGPT or Google.
- **Free:** A free version exists, with no obligation to pay for basic features.
- **More respectful of data:** : Lower risk of your exchanges being used for commercial or policing purposes.

## How to Access It?

It’s simple:
- Open an internet browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).
- Go to lechat.mistral.ai.
- Create an account (with an email address; no phone number required).
- ou’ll arrive at a page with a text box: this is where you’ll chat with the AI.

## First Interaction: Ask a Simple Question

AI works like a conversation. To start, ask it a clear and precise question. For example:
- "Can you explain inflation to me in simple terms?"
- "Help me draft a leaflet for a protest against layoffs."
- "What are the arguments against pension reform?"

After receiving a response, you can react to its content by replying —- it’s an interactive exchange.

### A Few Tips:
- **Be specific:** The clearer your request, the better the response.
- **Always proofread:** AI can make mistakes or overlook nuances. Correct, supplement, and adapt as needed.
- **Don’t share sensitive information:** Avoid names, addresses, or personal data.

### Example Exchange:
- You: "I’m preparing a meeting on social housing. Can you list 5 arguments against the privatization of public housing?"
- AI: "Here are 5 key arguments: 1) Rent increases, 2) Exclusion of low-income households, 3) Real estate speculation, 4) Loss of social diversity, 5) State disengagement. Would you like me to elaborate on any point?"
You can then ask to delve deeper, rephrase, or generate a longer text.

## What to Expect?

- AI doesn’t "understand" in the human sense: It assembles information to respond. It doesn’t replace collective reflection or in-depth political analysis.
- It can fabricate information (these are called "hallucinations"). Always verify important facts with reliable sources (articles, reports, comrades).
- It doesn’t organize for you: It’s a tool, not a comrade. Use it to assist you, not to make decisions.

## Going Further (Without Getting Overwhelmed)

Once you’re comfortable:
- Try asking it to summarize a long text (an article, a report).
- Use it to translate militant documents (English → French, etc.).
- Ask it to generate ideas for slogans, posters, or action strategies.
Example: "I’m organizing a workshop on working-class feminists in the 1970s. Suggest 3 activities to facilitate the discussion."

The result might not be perfect right away, but it could point you in the right direction.

## Exploring Advanced Options

These are found in the left column of Mistral’s interface.

- **Projects:** : Organize and group your conversations, documents, and resources by theme or goal for structured and collaborative follow-up.
> For example, you can create a dedicated space for preparing a campaign against student precarity, centralizing all leaflets, meeting minutes, useful links, and exchanges with collective members.
- **Agents** : Easily design specialized assistants for specific tasks[^5] (research, analysis, writing). 
> For example, you can configure an agent to help with writing articles by feeding it previous articles you’ve written as examples to improve the syntax and structure of generated texts according to your expectations.
- **Intelligence** : Feed the AI persistent data, whether memories, personal information, connectors to other platforms (like Gmail for emails), or document libraries, so that the results benefit from this additional information.
> For example, you can request a critical and synthetic analysis of the latest government speeches on pension reform, with key arguments to fuel a public debate or a press release.

It may be tempting to share sensitive personal information: If you choose to do so, select it carefully.

As with AI in general, these advanced options are not yet capable of meeting all demands and may yield unsatisfactory results. Again, try to see how these tools, in their current state, can help you work faster —- without expecting them to do everything for you.

[^5]: Mistral uses the term "agent" for this functionality, but generally, an AI agent refers to something broader: an AI that interacts with other software (possibly other AIs) to autonomously or semi-autonomously perform tasks, such as responding to emails.

## Militant Precautions

- **Anonymity:** Do not provide information that could identify individuals or groups.
- **Critical Approach:** AI can reproduce stereotypes (sexist, racist, etc.). Report and correct them.
- **Alternatives:** For highly sensitive topics, prioritize human discussions or existing militant resources (brochures, collective websites, etc.).

## In Summary:

- Choose a tool (Mistral is a good starting point).
- Ask clear questions and proofread the responses.
- Stay in control: AI is a helper, not a leader.
- Experiment without pressure: The more you practice, the better you’ll know when and how to use it.
