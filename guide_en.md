# Introduction

***by Hugo Pompougnac***

For the revolutionary activist, AI[^1] is primarily a matter of political economy.The media and political establishment that sings its praises thereby sings the praises of neoliberal capitalism, the unbridled entrepreneurship that reigns in Silicon Valley, the data industry, the individualization of social life, the domination of labor by capital, and the overexploitation of resources[^2]. Activist discourse therefore spontaneously takes the opposite stance: it denounces the propaganda of Sam Altman and his friends[^3], whose techno-capitalist utopia is becoming less and less credible. We are up in arms over the sufferings that corporations inflict on workers under the pretext of innovation. We question the impact of emerging practices on our common humanity, for instance by wondering whether people will still be able to think for themselves in the future.

There is, of course, one essential aspect of the problem that remains to be addressed. AI is a general-purpose information processing technology[^4], just like printed books, photography, and film. Therefore, activist groups are embracing it, perhaps tentatively, with varying degrees of perspective, but they are embracing it nonetheless. Here in France, for example, social media has been flooded all summer with AI-generated caricatures of François Bayrou (the former prime minister). Beyond images, it is not uncommon to come across a comrade who uses AI to simplify the reading of a parliamentary report or the translation of a text.

However, these militant uses of AI have two limitations:

1- They sometimes lack perspective. Using a generative AI chatbot effectively and reworking the results is difficult, but absolutely essential if we want to avoid inadvertently spreading misinformation or degrading political discourse. In fact, this type of software can be very useful, but at some point it will make mistakes, either because it "*hallucinates*" due to limitations in its design, or because it has been asked a question that is too vague. This can result in mixed information, invented sources, problematic symbolism, etc. This is not a problem as long as the user is careful and anticipates or corrects errors, but it can cause serious problems if care is not taken.
2- They are not equally adopted across the population, with very different rates depending on class -- obviously -- but also on age and place of residence, as new technologies penetrate much more slowly in the suburbs and countryside than in city centers.

And yet, we believe that the radical left must become collectively proficient in AI. The challenge is technical -- it's about working more efficiently -- but it's also political, in the sense of the actual struggle itself. The ease with which we use 21st-century tools will lend us credibility, give confidence to our supporters, and, at the same time, discourage our opponents: neo-liberals, the far right, etc. Indeed, it is never encouraging to feel outdated or archaic.

That is the intention of this guide. It is designed so that anyone can dive right in, with or without prior computer knowledge, and make rapid progress. We wanted it to be useful for beginners and experienced users alike, with descriptions of advanced techniques for getting the most out of AI.

The version we are publishing today is a very early release of the guide. Many aspects are imperfect or incomplete. We intend to improve it as our work progresses and as we receive feedback from comrades. Please feel free to share your comments, criticisms, and suggestions with us at contact@espaces-marx.eu!

Until then... Happy reading!


[^1]: The word AI, for "Artificial Intelligence," is clearly misleading and belongs more to the realm of science fiction than to technical description. In fact, intelligence is a complex phenomenon that this kind of software is still a long way from being able to simulate. However, the term has made its way into public discourse, so we've decided to use it to make this guide more accessible, or at least to avoid creating barriers to reading by using less common terms. The software we refer to when we talk about AI is therefore essentially large language models based on the Transformer architecture that users manipulate through a chat-type interface.

# How to Start Using AI?

***By Anaïs Fley and Antoni Bourdel***


## Where to Begin?

There are dozens of AI tools available, but not all are equal. Here are some common options:

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :-------- | :------------ |
| **Mistral AI (Le Chat)** | Partially open source, subject to European law, which is more protective of personal data. | Not as widespread as American giants, sometimes less intuitive interface. Capitalist company closely linked to the French government. |
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** | Very popular, simple interface. | Proprietary, controlled by Silicon Valley capitalists, massive data collection. |
| **Deepseek** | Free, partially open source. | Data security and management still poorly documented, closely monitored by the Chinese government, sometimes slow due to server overloads. |

***Why do we recommend Mistral?***

- **More reliable:** Mistral is a European company, less tied to American giants like ChatGPT or Google.
- **Free:** A free version exists, with no obligation to pay for basic features.
- **More respectful of your data:** : Lower risk of your exchanges being used for commercial or policing purposes.


### How to Access It?

It’s simple:

- Open an internet browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.);
- Go to lechat.mistral.ai;
- Create an account (with an email address; no phone number required);
- You’ll arrive at a page with a text box: this is where you’ll chat with the AI.


### First Interaction: Ask a Simple Question

AI works like a conversation. To start, ask it a clear and precise question. For example:

- *"Can you explain inflation to me in simple terms?"*
- *"Help me draft a leaflet for a protest against layoffs."*
- *"What are the arguments against pension reform?"*

After receiving a response, you can react to its content by replying -- it’s an interactive exchange.


#### A Few Tips:

- **Be specific:** The clearer your request, the better the response.
- **Always proofread:** AI can make mistakes or overlook nuances. Correct, supplement, and adapt as needed.
- **Don’t share sensitive information:** Avoid names, addresses, or personal data.


#### Example Exchange:

- ***You:*** *"I’m preparing a meeting on social housing. Can you list 5 arguments against the privatization of public housing?"*
- ***AI:*** *"Here are 5 key arguments: 1) Rent increases, 2) Exclusion of low-income households, 3) Real estate speculation, 4) Loss of social diversity, 5) State disengagement. Would you like me to elaborate on any point?"*

You can then ask to delve deeper, rephrase, or generate a longer text.


### What to Expect?

- **AI doesn’t "understand" in the human sense:** It assembles information to respond. It doesn’t replace collective reflection or in-depth political analysis.
- **It can fabricate information** (these are called "hallucinations"). Always verify important facts with reliable sources (articles, reports, comrades).
- **It won't do your campaigning for you:** It’s a tool, not a comrade. Use it to assist you, not to make decisions.


### Militant Precautions

- **Anonymity:** Do not provide information that could identify individuals or groups.
- **Critical Approach:** AI can reproduce stereotypes (sexist, racist, etc.). Report and correct them.
- **Alternatives:** For highly sensitive topics, prioritize human discussions or existing militant resources (brochures, collective websites, etc.).


### A Few Steps Further (Without Getting Overwhelmed)

Once you’re comfortable:

- Try asking it to summarize a long text (an article, a report);
- Use it to translate militant documents (English -> French, etc.);
- Ask it to generate ideas for slogans, posters, or action strategies.

Example: *"I’m organizing a workshop on working-class feminists in the 1970s. Suggest 3 activities to fuel the discussion."*


The result may not be perfect from the outset, but it should put you on the right track.


## Exploring Advanced Options

These are found in the left column of Mistral’s interface.

- **Projects:** : Organize and group your conversations, documents, and resources by theme or goal for structured and collaborative follow-up.

*For example, you can create a dedicated space for preparing a campaign against student poverty, centralizing all leaflets, meeting minutes, useful links, and exchanges with collective members.*

- **Agents** : Easily design specialized assistants for specific tasks[^5] (research, analysis, writing).

*For example, you can configure an agent to help with writing articles by feeding it previous articles you’ve written as examples to improve the syntax and structure of generated texts according to your expectations.*

- **Intelligence** : Feed the AI persistent data, whether memories, personal information, connectors to other platforms (like Gmail for emails), or document libraries, so that the results benefit from this additional information.

*For example, you can request a critical and synthetic analysis of the latest government speeches on pension reform, with key arguments to fuel a public debate or a press release.*

It may be tempting to share sensitive personal information: If you choose to do so, select it carefully.

As with AI in general, these advanced options are not yet capable of meeting all demands and may yield unsatisfactory results. Again, try to see how these tools, in their current state, can help you work faster -- without expecting them to do everything for you.

[^5]: Mistral uses the term "agent" for this functionality, but generally, an AI agent refers to something broader: an AI that interacts with other software (possibly other AIs) to autonomously or semi-autonomously perform tasks, such as responding to emails.


## Use AI locally



## Using AI locally

**What exactly is a *"local AI"*?**

The AI services we use are software like any other; just like the Office suite, we can use them online or locally. When you use online software, it is on the *"cloud"*, meaning that it is run from servers that may be located on the other side of the world, in data centers. These centers are places where numerous computers with significant storage and computing capacities are gathered for efficiency and energy gains. 

**Conversely, *"local"* AI is -- *as its name suggests* -- stored and executed locally, meaning on your computer.** Using AI in this way gives you access not only to the models distributed by companies, but also to numerous models created by online communities, including some uncensored versions of corporate models.


### Why would anyone install AI *locally*?

*Using a local AI has many advantages.* 

- **Complete control over your own data** 

Apart from potential internet browsing, all your messages and those generated by AI remain on your own computer. No personal data passes through data centers hosted by different states and governments, and no big digital companies have any access to it. 

- **Using at least partially open-source software** 

Not all of us have the time or skills to dig into the code of the programs we use. That said, all AIs that can be installed locally are at least partially open-source, meaning that their code is accessible to anyone who wishes to have a look at it. Given the interest around the world for AI, this particular feature gives us a certain level of security: the behavior of these programs is fairly well documented and understood, making it difficult to hide malicious code that would share your data without your consent. 

However, many of these programs are not considered to be fully open-source because their training data is often not publicly available. Competition and sensitive information (such as use of copyrighted content) are often cited as reasons for this.

- **By far the least carbon-intensive use of AI**

According to ADEME, in 2022 in France, 46% of CO2 emissions linked to the digital sector were attributable to data centers[^6], almost as much as the 50% of emissions generated by the manufacture and usage of all our digital devices (smartphones, computers, etc.). Why are data centers so carbon-intensive? Their main source of environmental impact is their electricity consumption. In the major countries that host these centers, the share of dirty energy sources such as coal and gas power generation is still very high. This is especially true in the United States, which powers 45% of global data center consumption[^7].

When using AI locally, the only energy you consume is what your computer uses, and its impact in terms of emissions depends on your country's energy mix. For example, in France, the electricity generated produces 9 times less CO2 emissions than in the United States!

- **Own your work tool**

One final advantage: if an AI is installed on your computer, you are no longer subject to the decisions of the company that produced it. This applies, among other things, to the rapid pace at which new versions of the program are released, which will influence how you work with AI, but also to arbitrary instructions that may be added to it. 

An *extreme* example of this type of instruction on Grok (Elon Musk's AI): *"Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation"* (since removed)

Even short of political manipulation of this kind, it is easy to imagine various decisions linked to the interests of large companies that could damage the tool's capabilities, for example through more or less disguised advertising. Many free and useful services such as Google have, after all, evolved over time in this direction.

***Great! Why aren't we all already using local AI?***

While using your own computer has the advantage of securing your data and limiting the impact of your usage, it has the disadvantage of making you dependent on its computing power alone. In a data center, computers pool their resources and are increasingly equipped with AI-dedicated hardware, which is not generally true for home computers. 

This means it's unlikely you'll be able to install the most advanced AI or solve the most complex tasks from your computer unless you're really well equipped. Still, given all the advantages listed above, why not try to find out how much of your AI usage could be done locally? 


### Some information before going further

**What is an AI *"model"*?**

ChatGPT-5, Mistral Medium 3.1, and DeepSeek V3 are three examples of generative AI *models*. Each has been *"trained"* on a specific selection of texts, according to its own methods, and then programmed differently, resulting in a unique behavior. The same message sent to these three models will most likely yield three different responses.

**AIs of various *"sizes"***

Simply put, the size of a model refers to both the amount of information it retains and the computing power it will need to function properly. Overall, the *"larger"* a model is, the more complex tasks it will be able to handle.

Size is expressed in the number of parameters of a model, which now generally range from 1 to 2 billion for the smallest models, a few tens to a hundred billion for medium-sized models, and several hundred billion for the largest models. 

**How to find out the size of an AI model?**

Open-source models are very straightforward: it's in their name. It usually includes a number followed by the letter *"B"* for billions. For instance, *"Mistral 24B"* is a 24 billion parameters model, which is a lower-end medium size. 

**Potential uses based on your hardware**

On Windows, you can open your settings, then go to the “System” and “About” sections to find details about your hardware. A graphics card (GPU) should be listed there if it is present.

If your computer does not have a graphics card, unfortunately you will probably not be able to do much locally. You will still be able to try out very small models, but expect slow generations and limited complexity.

**Fitting AI into your machine: quantization**

So how can we get a program like generative AI -- *which has at least several billion parameters* -- to run on our machines? Quantization is a technique that reduces the length of the numbers processed by AI to calculate its responses, allowing it to run using less memory (RAM/VRAM) and take up less space on a hard drive. 

Quantized and therefore optimized AI models can be selected directly from those offered by local AI platforms. You can recognize them by the letter *"Q"* immediately followed by a number in their name. For example: *"gemma-3-12b-it-qat-**q4**"* is one of the quantized versions (a *"q4"* qantization) of Gemma, Google's own family of *"open"* models (its closed-source equivalent is Gemini). 

**Important** : Using a quantized model carries a higher risk of AI hallucinations. This risk remains fairly low as long as you do not use quantization lower than 4 bits (like *"Q3"* or *"Q2"*).

Here is a very rough estimate (there are many variables and they change frequently) of what you can do, depending on your hardware:

| Size           | Hardware                                                             | Possible tasks                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **< 3B**       | Standard PC (8-16 Go RAM)                                            | Génération de Simple text (short answers, suggestions, basic chat), grammar correction, very short summaries.                                                                                               |
| **3B - 7B**    | High-performance laptop (16-32 Go RAM) or desktop PC (lower-end GPU) | Better text generation (emails, short articles, dialogues), basic translation, idea generation.                                                                                                             |
| **7B - 13B**   | Desktop PC with Mid-tier GPU, 32 Go RAM                              | Advanced text generation (long articles, simple code, scenarios), writing assistance, story generation, tabular data analysis                                                                               |
| **13B - 30B**  | Desktop PC with High-end GPU, 64 Go RAM                              | Complex code generation, technical writing, creative content creation, in-depth document analysis                                                                                                           |
| **30B - 70B+** | Professional workstation, Multiple GPUs, 128 Go RAM+                 | Modèles polyvalents pour des tâches professionnelles (traduction spécialisée, génération de rapports, analyse de données complexes), création de contenu multimédia (scripts, dialogues), recherche avancée |

**NB** : In this table, memory is referred to as RAM. Actually, the most efficient type of memory for AI-related tasks is VRAM (Video RAM), which is memory from the GPU (graphics card/processor). It is possible to use AI locally with little or no VRAM, but the generations will be slower.


### How to install and use a local AI?

**Step 1: Download LM Studio**

LM Studio is free software that allows you to download and use AI on your computer. 

1. **Download LM Studio** from the official website: *lmstudio.ai* 
2. **Install it** like any other software.
3. **Launch LM Studio**.

**Step 2: Select and download an AI model**

In LM Studio, you will see a list of models organized by size and purpose.

- **To get started**, choose a lightweight model (less than 4 GB) to get an idea of your computer's performance on AI tasks. The first models offered to you are likely to be those that match your hardware capabilities, as LM Studio makes recommendations based on your equipment. 
- Click **"Download"** next to the selected model.

**Step 3: Run the AI and start a chat**

1. Once the download is complete, click on the ***chat*** tab.
2. Click **"Select a model to load"**, and select the model you just downloaded (this may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes).
3. Once the download is complete, click on the “Create a New Chat” button: **you can now chat with your local AI!**


### Going further

A way to use artificial intelligence without having to depend on the whims of American tech bosses? Sounds like the future.

With improvements in hardware (computers, smartphones, and tablets) and the importance of open-source models in current AI development, this approach may become more widespread.

***Why not take the initiative and learn how to use it?***

You could, for example, explore the HuggingFace platform, which is both the reference library for all open-source AI models (currently, there are over 2 million) and a training space.

# How Can AI Be Useful in Activist Life?

***By Anaïs Fley***


AI is not here to replace collective intelligence or militant work, but to save time, simplify technical tasks, and amplify the impact of our actions. Here are three concrete situations where it can be an asset, with examples drawn from militant current events.


## Writing a Short, Mobilizing Leaflet

> *See the full example [in the appendix](#example-leaflet).*


### Situation:

A demonstration or strike is planned (e.g., against government policy, a general mobilization day). You need a punchy leaflet, quick to distribute, that inspires action. A statement has already been published in response to government announcements.

***Why use AI?***

- It helps **skip the blank page stage**: you can build on initial elements obtained quickly.
- It **summarizes key issues** from an article or statement.
- It **suggests mobilizing phrasing** (slogans, calls to action).
- It **adapts the tone** (urgent, combative, educational).


### Concrete Example:

Based on a *given statement* attached, ask:

*"Write a 500-character leaflet for a demonstration against government policy, using this statement. Use a combative tone, summarizing the 3 key arguments from the statement and the call to join the demo. Reuse the statement’s title and add a catchy slogan."*


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **Layout software** (Canva, LibreOffice) to produce the leaflet, add colors, logos, or images.
- **Collective proofreading** to ensure the message aligns with the group’s political line.
- **As many collectively developed content elements as possible:** : the best slogans and demands are those activists create themselves, based on their understanding of the audience’s mindset.


### Caution:

- **Verify** dates, locations, and demands: AI can invent or distort information.
- **Personalize** with local details (meeting place, contacts).
  

## Turning an Article into a Short Video Script

See the full example [in the appendix](#example-script).


### Situation:

Your collective wants to publish a video on social media to explain an issue (e.g., why September 10 is a key date). You have a reference article but no time to adapt it for oral delivery.

*Why use AI?*

- It extracts key ideas and **reformulates them for speech**.
- It **suggests a structure** (introduction, development, conclusion).
- It **adjusts the pace** for a 1- to 3-minute video.


### How to Do It?

Paste the article link and ask:

*"Turn this article into a script for a 2-minute face-camera video. Use an engaged tone, with short sentences and pauses for breathing."*

Specify the style: *"Speak directly to the camera, as if addressing comrades."*


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **A smartphone or camera** (even a basic one).
- **A decent microphone** (or a quiet place to avoid background noise).
- **Editing software** (CapCut, OpenShot) (CapCut, OpenShot) to add subtitles or archive images.


### Caution:

- **Test** the script aloud: Some phrases may read well but sound awkward when spoken.
- **Add** images or subtitles to make the video more dynamic.


## Creating a Tutorial for Activists

A tutorial is a step-by-step guide that explains how to acquire a new skill.

> *For example, a tutorial on how to use a kettle would detail all these steps:*
>
> *1. First, plug it in.*
>
> *2. Add water (preferably filtered to avoid limescale buildup).*
>
> *3. Press the button to heat (for newer models, explain how to select the right temperature).*
>
> *4. Wait for the kettle to beep, indicating the water has reached the desired temperature (or 100°C by default).
>
> *5. Choose a suitable container for the amount of hot water needed (pot for pasta, cup for tea, etc.) and its heat resistance (avoid plastic cups).
>
> *6. Be careful not to burn yourself when pouring boiling water, handling the container, or drinking.
>
> *7. Ensure the kettle is turned off.
>
> *8. Regularly maintain the kettle (detail cleaning steps).
>
> This example shows that even if it seems overly detailed, each step is important: what’s obvious to some may not be to others and could block their understanding!


### Situation:

Your collective wants to train members in a new skill (e.g., organizing a general assembly, using encryption tools, planning a direct action). Writing a clear, educational tutorial takes time, especially if the topic is technical or unfamiliar.

*Why use AI?*

- It can **structure information** from existing notes or resources.
- It **adapts language** to make it accessible to everyone.
- It **generates examples** or detailed steps.


### How to Do It?

- **Provide a base:** paste notes, an article, or a list of ideas.
- **Specify the audience:** "Write a tutorial for beginner activists, with simple steps and concrete examples."
- **Request an adapted format:** “make me a 2-page handout, with boxes for key points.”


### What You Need Beyond AI:

- **Proofread and test** the tutorial with comrades to ensure clarity, functionality, and accuracy.
- **Write** what you can, add phrases, and make the text your own.
- **Add** visuals (diagrams, screenshots) if needed.


### Caution:

AI may omit important details or suggest methods unsuitable for your context. **Always adapt the result to your local reality.**


## When Is AI Not Suitable?

- **For complex political positions:** AI cannot replace collective debate.
- **For highly technical or local topics:** it may lack precision.
- **For sensitive content** (action strategies, confidential information).

To sum up:

| Task             | AI Usefulness          | What else you need        | Caution          |
| :--------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------- |
| **Leaflet**      | Summarize, mobilize    | Layout, local info        | Fact-check       |
| **Video Script** | Adapt for speech, pace | Audio/video gear, editing | Test aloud       |
| **Tutorial**     | Structure, simplify    | Proofreading, visuals     | Adapt to context |


# Ask Smart, Get More: Techniques for Guiding AI 


# Wrap-up

***by Hugo Pompougnac***

You have reached the end of this short guide (excluding the annexes). We do hope you enjoyed reading it, or at least found it useful. If so, we have a favor to ask of you. As mentioned in the introduction, this version of the guide is still very much a work in progress. We believe there is plenty to add, perhaps remove, correct, and improve. With this in mind, our primary concern is its usefulness to activists, so your feedback after reading it is very important. Please email us at contact@espaces-marx.eu with any comments, criticism, or suggestions.

You can also write to us if you would like to actively contribute to the writing process. If you are comfortable with digital tools, we invite you to interact with us via GitHub, visit the guide repository (github.com/espaces-marx/ai-radicals), fork it, and send us a Pull Request. We welcome all contributions and would be happy to build a larger activist community, working together to develop skills so that the left can better master new technologies.

For the moment, our intention for the next version of the guide is to:  

- Provide concrete examples and in-depth explanations of "advanced" AI tools (agents, connectors, libraries, etc.).
- Detail other tools; for now, we have focused on Mistral, although much of our advice applies equally well to other AIs.
- Provide more specific advice on AI-assisted data synthesis (summarizing a legal text, etc.).
- Teach AI-assisted graphic design techniques: not just by writing a trivial prompt and marveling at the result, but by combining AI with other techniques to create a poster, sticker, Instagram visual, etc.

Looking ahead, we would like to explain (in the clearest way possible) how to retrain an AI model at home to transform its purpose. But that's a more geeky goal; for the time being, we believe there are more pressing matters.

If you would like to comment on these objectives or suggest others, please contact us at our email address.

*Arrivederci!*
