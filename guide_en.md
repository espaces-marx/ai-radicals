# Introduction

***by Hugo Pompougnac***

For the revolutionary activist, AI[^1] is primarily a matter of political economy.The media and political establishment that sings its praises thereby sings the praises of neoliberal capitalism, the unbridled entrepreneurship that reigns in Silicon Valley, the data industry, the individualization of social life, the domination of labor by capital, and the overexploitation of resources[^2]. Activist discourse therefore spontaneously takes the opposite stance: it denounces the propaganda of Sam Altman and his friends[^3], whose techno-capitalist utopia is becoming less and less credible. We are up in arms over the sufferings that corporations inflict on workers under the pretext of innovation. We question the impact of emerging practices on our common humanity, for instance by wondering whether people will still be able to think for themselves in the future.

There is, of course, one essential aspect of the problem that remains to be addressed. AI is a general-purpose information processing technology[^4], just like printed books, photography, and film. Therefore, activist groups are embracing it, perhaps tentatively, with varying degrees of perspective, but they are embracing it nonetheless. Here in France, for example, social media has been flooded all summer with AI-generated caricatures of François Bayrou (the former prime minister). Beyond images, it is not uncommon to come across a comrade who uses AI to simplify the reading of a parliamentary report or the translation of a text.

However, these militant uses of AI have two limitations:

1- They sometimes lack perspective. Using a generative AI chatbot effectively and reworking the results is difficult, but absolutely essential if we want to avoid inadvertently spreading misinformation or degrading political discourse. In fact, this type of software can be very useful, but at some point it will make mistakes, either because it "*hallucinates*" due to limitations in its design, or because it has been asked a question that is too vague. This can result in mixed information, invented sources, problematic symbolism, etc. This is not a problem as long as the user is careful and anticipates or corrects errors, but it can cause serious problems if care is not taken.
2- They are not equally adopted across the population, with very different rates depending on class -- obviously -- but also on age and place of residence, as new technologies penetrate much more slowly in the suburbs and countryside than in city centers.

And yet, we believe that the radical left must become collectively proficient in AI. The challenge is technical -- it's about working more efficiently -- but it's also political, in the sense of the actual struggle itself. The ease with which we use 21st-century tools will lend us credibility, give confidence to our supporters, and, at the same time, discourage our opponents: neo-liberals, the far right, etc. Indeed, it is never encouraging to feel outdated or archaic.

That is the intention of this guide. It is designed so that anyone can dive right in, with or without prior computer knowledge, and make rapid progress. We wanted it to be useful for beginners and experienced users alike, with descriptions of advanced techniques for getting the most out of AI.

The version we are publishing today is a very early release of the guide. Many aspects are imperfect or incomplete. We intend to improve it as our work progresses and as we receive feedback from comrades. Please feel free to share your comments, criticisms, and suggestions with us at contact@espaces-marx.eu!

Until then... Happy reading!


[^1]: The word AI, for "Artificial Intelligence," is clearly misleading and belongs more to the realm of science fiction than to technical description. In fact, intelligence is a complex phenomenon that this kind of software is still a long way from being able to simulate. However, the term has made its way into public discourse, so we've decided to use it to make this guide more accessible, or at least to avoid creating barriers to reading by using less common terms. The software we refer to when we talk about AI is therefore essentially large language models based on the Transformer architecture that users manipulate through a chat-type interface.

# How to Start Using AI?

***By Anaïs Fley and Antoni Bourdel***


## Where to Begin?

There are dozens of AI tools available, but not all are equal. Here are some common options:

| Tool | Pros | Cons |
| :---- | :-------- | :------------ |
| **Mistral AI (Le Chat)** | Partially open source, subject to European law, which is more protective of personal data. | Less well-known than American giants, sometimes less intuitive interface. Capitalist company closely linked to the French government. |
| **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** | Very popular, simple interface. | Proprietary, controlled by Silicon Valley capitalists, massive data collection. |
| **Deepseek** | Free, partially open source. | Data security and management still poorly documented, closely monitored by the Chinese government, sometimes slow due to server overloads. |

***Why do we recommend Mistral?***

- **More reliable:e** Mistral is a European company, less tied to American giants like ChatGPT or Google.
- **Free:** A free version exists, with no obligation to pay for basic features.
- **More respectful of data:** : Lower risk of your exchanges being used for commercial or policing purposes.


### How to Access It?

It’s simple:

- Open an internet browser (Firefox, Chrome, etc.).
- Go to lechat.mistral.ai.
- Create an account (with an email address; no phone number required).
- ou’ll arrive at a page with a text box: this is where you’ll chat with the AI.


### First Interaction: Ask a Simple Question

AI works like a conversation. To start, ask it a clear and precise question. For example:

- *"Can you explain inflation to me in simple terms?"*
- *"Help me draft a leaflet for a protest against layoffs."*
- *"What are the arguments against pension reform?"*

After receiving a response, you can react to its content by replying —- it’s an interactive exchange.

#### A Few Tips:

- **Be specific:** The clearer your request, the better the response.
- **Always proofread:** AI can make mistakes or overlook nuances. Correct, supplement, and adapt as needed.
- **Don’t share sensitive information:** Avoid names, addresses, or personal data.

#### Example Exchange:

- ***You:*** *"I’m preparing a meeting on social housing. Can you list 5 arguments against the privatization of public housing?"*
- ***AI:*** *"Here are 5 key arguments: 1) Rent increases, 2) Exclusion of low-income households, 3) Real estate speculation, 4) Loss of social diversity, 5) State disengagement. Would you like me to elaborate on any point?"*

You can then ask to delve deeper, rephrase, or generate a longer text.


### What to Expect?

- **AI doesn’t "understand" in the human sense:** It assembles information to respond. It doesn’t replace collective reflection or in-depth political analysis.
- **It can fabricate information** (these are called "hallucinations"). Always verify important facts with reliable sources (articles, reports, comrades).
- **It doesn’t do the activism in your place:** It’s a tool, not a comrade. Use it to assist you, not to make decisions.


### Militant Precautions

- **Anonymity:** Do not provide information that could identify individuals or groups.
- **Critical Approach:** AI can reproduce stereotypes (sexist, racist, etc.). Report and correct them.
- **Alternatives:** For highly sensitive topics, prioritize human discussions or existing militant resources (brochures, collective websites, etc.).


### Going Further (Without Getting Overwhelmed)

Once you’re comfortable:

- Try asking it to summarize a long text (an article, a report).
- Use it to translate militant documents (English → French, etc.).
- Ask it to generate ideas for slogans, posters, or action strategies.

Example: *"I’m organizing a workshop on working-class feminists in the 1970s. Suggest 3 activities to facilitate the discussion."*


The result might not be perfect right away, but it could point you in the right direction.


## Exploring Advanced Options

These are found in the left column of Mistral’s interface.

- **Projects:** : Organize and group your conversations, documents, and resources by theme or goal for structured and collaborative follow-up.

*For example, you can create a dedicated space for preparing a campaign against student precarity, centralizing all leaflets, meeting minutes, useful links, and exchanges with collective members.*

- **Agents** : Easily design specialized assistants for specific tasks[^5] (research, analysis, writing).

*For example, you can configure an agent to help with writing articles by feeding it previous articles you’ve written as examples to improve the syntax and structure of generated texts according to your expectations.*

- **Intelligence** : Feed the AI persistent data, whether memories, personal information, connectors to other platforms (like Gmail for emails), or document libraries, so that the results benefit from this additional information.

*For example, you can request a critical and synthetic analysis of the latest government speeches on pension reform, with key arguments to fuel a public debate or a press release.*

It may be tempting to share sensitive personal information: If you choose to do so, select it carefully.

As with AI in general, these advanced options are not yet capable of meeting all demands and may yield unsatisfactory results. Again, try to see how these tools, in their current state, can help you work faster —- without expecting them to do everything for you.

[^5]: Mistral uses the term "agent" for this functionality, but generally, an AI agent refers to something broader: an AI that interacts with other software (possibly other AIs) to autonomously or semi-autonomously perform tasks, such as responding to emails.

# Wrap-up

***by Hugo Pompougnac***

You have reached the end of this short guide (excluding the annexes). We do hope you enjoyed reading it, or at least found it useful. If so, we have a favor to ask of you. As mentioned in the introduction, this version of the guide is still very much a work in progress. We believe there is plenty to add, perhaps remove, correct, and improve. With this in mind, our primary concern is its usefulness to activists, so your feedback after reading it is very important. Please email us at contact@espaces-marx.eu with any comments, criticism, or suggestions.

You can also write to us if you would like to actively contribute to the writing process. If you are comfortable with digital tools, we invite you to interact with us via GitHub, visit the guide repository (github.com/espaces-marx/ai-radicals), fork it, and send us a Pull Request. We welcome all contributions and would be happy to build a larger activist community, working together to develop skills so that the left can better master new technologies.

For the moment, our intention for the next version of the guide is to:  

- Provide concrete examples and in-depth explanations of "advanced" AI tools (agents, connectors, libraries, etc.).
- Detail other tools; for now, we have focused on Mistral, although much of our advice applies equally well to other AIs.
- Provide more specific advice on AI-assisted data synthesis (summarizing a legal text, etc.).
- Teach AI-assisted graphic design techniques: not just by writing a trivial prompt and marveling at the result, but by combining AI with other techniques to create a poster, sticker, Instagram visual, etc.

Looking ahead, we would like to explain (in the clearest way possible) how to retrain an AI model at home to transform its purpose. But that's a more geeky goal; for the time being, we believe there are more pressing matters.

If you would like to comment on these objectives or suggest others, please contact us at our email address.

*Arrivederci!*
