This short, evolving guide looks at AI as both a practical tool and a political issue. It offers simple ways for activists to get started -- choosing tools, drafting tracts, scripts, and tutorials -- while flagging risks like errors or data exposure. It shares basic prompting and fact-checking habits to keep outputs clear and responsible. Above all, it argues that collective, competent use of AI strengthens organizing power and credibility. This is a living, preliminary manual -- open to critique, contributions, and rapid improvement.

This is an international project. Currently, there are two versions available: English and French. However, if you'd like to propose a translation of the guide in another language, don't hesitate to submit a Pull Request -- we'd be delighted to include it.

The PDF versions of the guide are available here for [the French version](https://github.com/espaces-marx/ai-radicals/releases/latest/download/guide_fr.pdf) and there for [the English version](https://github.com/espaces-marx/ai-radicals/releases/latest/download/guide_en.pdf). They are also distributed on [the Espaces Marx website](https://www.espaces-marx.eu/). If you wish to generate them on your own machine, you'll need a Unix system (Mac or Linux) with the DejaVu fonts installed, as well as git, make, pandoc, and tex (mactex for MacOS, texlive-xetex for Ubuntu).

Once you've cloned this repository with git, simply run the `make` command at the root.
