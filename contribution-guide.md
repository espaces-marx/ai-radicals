*Contribution-relevant topics from A to Z*

-------------------
## Issues

**When to write one?** 
- The change you propose (its implementation) is not clear enough to be the subject of a PR, because different paths are available and should be discussed.
**How to write it?**
- Describe the feature you want to add, make propositions on how it could be implemented, explain why it is desirable.

-------------------
## Pull Requests

**Title**
Current convention:   
`Guide [Language] : (guide-section, or subject) - change summary`
- If your PR is not directly related to the guide contents, replace "Guide" with whatever-it-is that you're modifying.

**Description of the PR** 
- Should be reserved for high-level explanations like: "_My intention with this PR was..._"

**Review**
- The reviewer is responsible for verifying the implementation of the (*uncontested*) modifications they recommend. 
- Once all of your reviews have been integrated (and you have carefully checked their implementation), you can approve the PR

**Scope**
- Pull Requests should be small and focused on a simple and easy-to-explain objective, so that they're easier to understand and review.

## Releases

**Convention** AI for Radicals: `v[number]-[occasion]`
